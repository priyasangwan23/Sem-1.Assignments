Mumbai, the financial capital of India, is a city that never sleeps.<br>
 Known as the "City of Dreams," it is where tradition meets modernity <br>
 and where every street has a story to tell. From the iconic Gateway of<br>
  India, Marine Drive, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to the lively beaches of <br>
  Juhu and the glamour of Bollywood, Mumbai is a city full of contrasts and colors.<br> 
  It is the land of endless opportunities, resilience, and spirit, where people from <br>
  across the country come to chase their dreams. With its bustling markets, colonial architecture, <br>
  skyscrapers, and vibrant nightlife, Mumbai is not just a city—it’s an emotion <br>
  that lives in the hearts of millions.</p><br>
